## Abstract {-}

This study analyzes data from a Portuguese bank’s direct marketing campaigns to identify the key factors influencing
customer subscription to term deposits and to develop a predictive model for optimizing future outreach eﬀorts. Using
exploratory data analysis and supervised learning techniques, including logistic regression (LASSO), Random Forest,
and Boosting, we examine how demographic, behavioral, and macroeconomic variables aﬀect subscription behavior.

Our findings highlight the importance of previous campaign success, age, and macroeconomic indicators such as
Euribor rate, CPI, and employment variation. Among the tested models, Random Forest with a tuned threshold oﬀers
the best balance between sensitivity and precision, making it the most suitable for minimizing missed opportunities
while avoiding unnecessary contacts.

These insights provide actionable recommendations for designing more eﬀective, data-driven marketing strategies
tailored to customer profiles and economic contexts.
